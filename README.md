The use of CSV data providers for data-driven testing offers several key benefits. Firstly, it enables a clear separation between test data and test logic, 
making it easier to modify test data without having to revisit or alter the test code. This approach also enhances performance testing, 
as it allows for testing the software with large datasets efficiently. Additionally, CSV files support various types of data, providing flexibility in handling different test scenarios. Moreover, 
the simplicity of CSV files makes it easy to implement across multiple tests, ensuring reusability and scalability of your test cases.
